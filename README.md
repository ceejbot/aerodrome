=======

Nodecopter control abstractions: for your apocalyptic robot air force.

__Current version:__ not yet released  
Travis status TBD  

## The plan

Promises for anything that takes a callback in the ar-drone client library.

Events/streams for repeating events (still images, video, nav data you've asked to subscribe to).

Control primitives
	heading/setHeading
	altitude/setAltitude
	battery level / emitted warnings on battery level
	move (speed, time)
	position/setPosition (relative to starting point) ? 

stream images to files
give me the last image

## What's working

Nothing.

## What's not working

Everything.
